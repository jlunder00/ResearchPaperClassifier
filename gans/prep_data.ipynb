These young local associations -- including an important fraction whose\\nmembers are Hipparcos stars -- offer insights into the star formation process\\nin low-density environments, shed light on the substellar domain, and could\\nhave played an important role in the recent history of the local interstellar\\nmedium. Aims: To study the kinematic evolution of young local associations and\\ntheir relation to other young stellar groups and structures in the local\\ninterstellar medium, thus casting new light on recent star formation processes\\nin the solar neighbourhood. Methods: We compiled the data published in the\\nliterature for young local associations. Using a realistic Galactic potential\\nwe integrated the orbits for these associations and the Sco-Cen complex back in\\ntime. Results: Combining these data with the spatial structure of the Local\\nBubble and the spiral structure of the Galaxy, we propose a recent history of\\nstar formation in the solar neighbourhood. We suggest that both the Sco-Cen\\ncomplex and young local associations originated as a result of the impact of\\nthe inner spiral arm shock wave against a giant molecular cloud. The core of\\nthe giant molecular cloud formed the Sco-Cen complex, and some small cloudlets\\nin a halo around the giant molecular cloud formed young local associations\\nseveral million years later. We also propose a supernova in young local\\nassociations a few million years ago as the most likely candidate to have\\nreheated the Local Bubble to its present temperature.\\n',\n",

       " 1009378: '  When learning from a batch of logged bandit feedback, the discrepancy between\\nthe policy to be learned and the off-policy training data imposes statistical\\nand computational challenges. Unlike classical supervised learning and online\\nlearning settings, in batch contextual bandit learning, one only has access to\\na collection of logged feedback from the actions taken by a historical policy,\\nand expect to learn a policy that takes good actions in possibly unseen\\ncontexts. Such a batch learning setting is ubiquitous in online and interactive\\nsystems, such as ad platforms and recommendation systems. Existing approaches\\nbased on inverse propensity weights, such as Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS)\\nand Policy Optimizer for Exponential Models (POEM), enjoy unbiasedness but\\noften suffer from large mean squared error. In this work, we introduce a new\\napproach named Maximum Likelihood Inverse Propensity Scoring (MLIPS) for batch\\nlearning from logged bandit feedback. Instead of using the given historical\\npolicy as the proposal in inverse propensity weights, we estimate a maximum\\nlikelihood surrogate policy based on the logged action-context pairs, and then\\nuse this surrogate policy as the proposal. We prove that MLIPS is\\nasymptotically unbiased, and moreover, has a smaller nonasymptotic mean squared\\nerror than IPS.

It is generally accepted that these jets are powered\\nelectromagnetically, by the magnetised rotation of a central compact object.\\nHowever, how they produce the observed emission and survive the propagation for\\nmany orders of magnitude in distance without being disrupted by current-driven\\nnon-axisymmetric instabilities is the subject of active debate. We carry out\\ntime-dependent 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of relativistic,\\nPoynting flux dominated jets. The jets are launched self-consistently by the\\nrotation of a strongly magnetised central compact object. This determines the\\nnatural degree of azimuthal magnetic field winding, a crucial factor that\\ncontrols jet stability. We find that the jets are susceptible to two types of\\ninstability: (i) a global, external kink mode that grows on long time scales\\nand causes the jets to bodily bend sideways. Whereas this mode does not cause\\njet disruption over the simulated distances, it substantially reduces jet\\npropagation speed. We show, via an analytic model, that the growth of the\\nexternal kink mode depends on the slope of the ambient medium density profile.\\nIn flat density distributions characteristic of galactic cores, an AGN jet may\\nstall, whereas in stellar envelopes the external kink weakens as the jet\\npropagates outward; (ii) a local, internal kink mode that grows over short time\\nscales and causes small-angle magnetic reconnection and conversion of about\\nhalf of jet electromagnetic energy flux into heat. Based on the robustness and\\nenergetics of the internal kink mode, we suggest that this instability is the\\nmain dissipation mechanism responsible for powering GRB prompt emission.\\n',\n",

To the\\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first paper to rigorously derive OTFS\\nmodulation from first principles.

Methods: We extend the propensity score weighting\\nmethodology to subgroup analyses by fitting a logistic propensity model with\\npre-specified covariate-subgroup interactions. We show that, by construction,\\noverlap weighting exactly balances the covariates with interaction terms in\\neach subgroup. Extensive simulations were performed to compare the operating\\ncharacteristics of unadjusted, different propensity score weighting and the\\nANCOVA estimator. We apply these methods to the HF-ACTION trial to evaluate the\\neffect of exercise training on 6-minute walk test in pre-specified subgroups.\\nResults: Standard errors of the adjusted estimators are smaller than those of\\nthe unadjusted estimator.

While the number density of luminous (massive) ETGs with\\nM_B(z=0)< -20.5 (Mass > 10^11 M_Sun) is nearly constant since z~0.8, less\\nluminous galaxies display a deficit which grows with redshift and that can be\\nexplained with a gradual population of the ETG \"red sequence\" by the\\nprogressive quenching of star formation in galaxies less massive than ~10^11\\nM_Sun.

In this paper we first review the SFA in the form developed by us in the\\nlast 25 years. In this approach SFA is a method to solve the TDSE using a\\nsystematic perturbation theory in a part of the Hamiltonian describing\\ncontinuum-continuum transitions in the presence of the laser field. In this\\nreview we focus on recent applications of SFA to HHG, ATI and NSMI from\\nmulti-electron atoms and from multi-atom. The main novel part of the presented\\ntheory concerns generalizations of SFA to: (i) time-dependent treatment of\\ntwo-electron atoms, allowing for studies of an interplay between Electron\\nImpact Ionization (EII) and Resonant Excitation with Subsequent Ionization\\n(RESI); (ii) time-dependent treatment in the single active electron (SAE)\\napproximation of \"large\" molecules and targets which are themselves undergoing\\ndynamics during the HHG or ATI process. In particular, we formulate the general\\nexpressions for the case of arbitrary molecules, combining input from quantum\\nchemistry and quantum dynamics. We formulate also theory of time-dependent\\nseparable molecular potentials to model analytically the dynamics of realistic\\nelectronic wave packets for molecules in strong laser fields.\\n',\n",

All the compositions show\\nferromagnetic/metal to paramagnetic/insulator transition except the Pb doped\\nsample which is insulating and ferromagnetic in the entire temperature range.\\nThe simultaneous occurrence of ferromagnetism and insulating behavior in Pb\\ndoped compound is most likely due to the presence of FM clusters separated by\\nFe and Mn ions that are coupled AFM and hence prevent the current from crossing\\nthe inter-domain region.

We observed that (for a fixed Fe content of 5%) the\\ntransition temperature and magnetic moment at 77 K is a maximum for Sr doped\\nsample and is decreasing if we increase or decrease the cation size from Sr\\nsize. The maximum value of Tc and magnetic moment for Sr based sample is most\\nlikely due to the closer ionic sizes of La and Sr as compared to the other\\ndopants (Ca, Pb, Ba). The decrease in the transition temperature and magnetic\\nmoment is due to the deviation of Mn-O-Mn angle from 1800 caused by the size\\nmismatch of the A site cations.

One of the peculiar characteristics of this problem is that\\naccretion takes place on the interior surface that separates the body from its\\nsupport rather than on its exterior surface, and hence is responsible for\\nstress accumulation. Simultaneously, ablation takes place at the outer surface\\nwhere material is removed from the body. As the body grows, mechanical effects\\nassociated with the build-up of stress and strain energy slow down accretion\\nand promote ablation. Eventually, the system reaches a point where internal\\naccretion is balanced by external ablation.

Here, two cases are considered: (i) the image\\nlocations of the human joints are provided and (ii) the image locations of\\njoints are unknown. In the former case, a novel approach is introduced that\\nintegrates a sparsity-driven 3D geometric prior and temporal smoothness. In the\\nlatter case, the former case is extended by treating the image locations of the\\njoints as latent variables. A deep fully convolutional network is trained to\\npredict the uncertainty maps of the 2D joint locations. The 3D pose estimates\\nare realized via an Expectation-Maximization algorithm over the entire\\nsequence, where it is shown that the 2D joint location uncertainties can be\\nconveniently marginalized out during inference. Empirical evaluation on the\\nHuman3.6M dataset shows that the proposed approaches achieve greater 3D pose\\nestimation accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines.

We show that CSMA/AP was successfully operated, even with dynamic\\nchanges of the spatial position of the terminal or the capability to\\naccommodate mobility, thanks to the real-time adaption to the dynamically\\nchanging environment by Wi-Wi. We also experimentally confirmed that the\\nproposed CSMA/AP principle cannot be executed without Wi-Wi, which validates\\nthe importance of precise time synchronization. This study paves the way toward\\nrealizing delay-bounded wireless communications for future low-latency and\\nhighly reliable critical applications.\\n',\n",

Our analysis focuses on two models\\nsuitable for the quantum simulation of the Schwinger Hamiltonian, or QED in 1+1\\ndimensions, which we investigate numerically using tensor networks. In\\nparticular, we explore the effect of representing the gauge degrees of freedom\\nwith finite-dimensional systems and show that the results converge rapidly;\\nthus even with small dimensions it is possible to obtain a reasonable accuracy.\\nWe also discuss the time scales required for the adiabatic preparation of the\\ninteracting vacuum state and observe that for a suitable ramping of the\\ninteraction the required time is almost insensitive to the system size and the\\ndimension of the physical systems. Finally, we address the possible presence of\\nnoninvariant terms in the Hamiltonian that is realized in the experiment and\\nshow that for low levels of noise it is still possible to achieve a good\\nprecision for some ground-state observables, even if the gauge symmetry is not\\nexact in the implemented model.\\n',\n",
       " 276803: '  Several authors have recently constructed characteristic classes for classes\\nof infinite rank vector bundles appearing in topology and physics. These\\ninclude the tangent bundle to the space of maps between closed manifolds, the\\ninfinite rank bundles in the families index theorem, and bundles with\\npseudodifferential operators as structure group. In this paper, we construct\\nthe corresponding K-theories for these types of bundles. We develop the\\nformalism of these theories and use their Chern character to detect a large\\nclass of nontrivial elements.\\n',\n",
       " 1603163: '  We propose a tractable semiparametric estimation method for dynamic discrete\\nchoice models.The distribution of additive utility shocks is modeled by\\nlocation-scale mixtures of extreme value distributions with varying numbers of\\nmixture components. Our approach exploits the analytical tractability of\\nextreme value distributions and the flexibility of the location-scale mixtures.\\nWe implement the Bayesian approach to inference using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo\\nand an approximately optimal reversible jump algorithm. For binary dynamic\\nchoice model, our approach delivers estimation results that are consistent with\\nthe previous literature. We also apply the proposed method to multinomial\\nchoice models, for which previous literature does not provide tractable\\nestimation methods in general settings without distributional assumptions on\\nthe utility shocks. In our simulation experiments, we show that the standard\\ndynamic logit model can deliver misleading results, especially about\\ncounterfactuals, when the shocks are not extreme value distributed. Our\\nsemiparametric approach delivers reliable inference in these settings. We\\ndevelop theoretical results on approximations by location-scale mixtures in an\\nappropriate distance and posterior concentration of the set identified utility\\nparameters and the distribution of shocks in the model.\\n',\n",
       " 1741614: '  We investigate the spin polarization of localized exciton-polariton\\ncondensates. We demonstrate the presence of an effective magnetic field leading\\nto the formation of elliptically polarized condensates. We show that this\\nsynthetic field has an entirely photonic origin, which we believe is unique for\\nthe CdTe-based microcavities. Moreover, the degree of spin polarization of\\nlocalized polariton condensates in samples with magnetic ions depends on the\\nexcitation power or polarization of the non-resonant excitation laser. In an\\nexternal magnetic field, the semimagnetic condensate spontaneously builds up\\nstrong spin polarization. Based on the magnetic field behavior of the\\ncondensate in the presence of magnetic ions, we apply a model that allows us to\\nestimate the polariton-polariton interaction strength in a CdTe-system to\\napprox. 0.8 $\\\\mu \\\\text{eV}\\\\!\\\\cdot\\\\!\\\\mu \\\\text{m}^2$.\\n',\n",
